# Sort

## Bubble sort: for each pair of indices, swap the items if out of order

## Cocktail shaker sort or bidirectional bubble sort, a bubble sort traversing the list alternately from front to back and back to front

## Comb sort

## Gnome sort

## Oddâ€“even sort

## Quicksort: divide list into two, with all items on the first list coming before all items on the second list.; then sort the two lists. Often the method of choice

## Bogosort

## Slowsort

## Stooge sort

## Flashsort

## Introsort: begin with quicksort and switch to heapsort when the recursion depth exceeds a certain level

## Timsort: adaptative algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort. Used in Python 2.3 and up, and Java SE 7.

## Insertion sort: determine where the current item belongs in the list of sorted ones, and insert it there

## Library sort

## Patience sorting

## Shell sort: an attempt to improve insertion sort

## Tree sort (binary tree sort): build binary tree, then traverse it to create sorted list

## Cycle sort: in-place with theoretically optimal number of writes

## Merge sort: sort the first and second half of the list separately, then merge the sorted lists

## Slowsort

## Strand sort

## Bead sort

## Bucket sort

## Burstsort: build a compact, cache efficient burst trie and then traverse it to create sorted output

## Counting sort

## Pigeonhole sort

## Postman sort: variant of Bucket sort which takes advantage of hierarchical structure

## Radix sort: sorts strings letter by letter

## Heapsort: convert the list into a heap, keep removing the largest element from the heap and adding it to the end of the list

## Selection sort: pick the smallest of the remaining elements, add it to the end of the sorted list

## Smoothsort

## Bitonic sorter

## Pancake sorting

## Spaghetti sort

## Topological sort

## Samplesort
